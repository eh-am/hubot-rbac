__This script relies on a new Hubot [v2.14.0](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v2140) feature known as ['listener middleware'](https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/803). It WILL NOT work on older versions of Hubot.__

A Hubot script for restricting access to commands through [role-based access control (RBAC)][rbac], and [Listener IDs][options].

Roles are automatically created when policies are added / removed (e.g. when a listener ID is blocked).

### Caveats

- Currently, the script can only block listeners IF they have an ID attached to it via their [options / metadata][options];
- Furthermore, the full ID must be specified when creating policies;
- None of the script's commands are blocked by default (i.e. anyone can use it, but they can not use it against a power user).

See [`src/rbac.coffee`](src/rbac.coffee) for full documentation.
